# e-commerce-follow-along

Key Features of the Project:

In this project, I will be building an E-Commerce app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Here is what I will be learning and working on:

REST API Creation: I will learn how to build scalable APIs to manage users, products, and orders, and get hands-on experience with backend development.

User Authentication: I will implement secure login and registration for users, which is a crucial part of any app that handles sensitive data.

Database Schema Design: I will explore MongoDB to design data models that are efficient and scalable for an e-commerce platform.

Backend Development: I will set up a server with Node.js and Express.js to handle requests, API routes, and interact with the database.

Frontend with React: I will use React to build dynamic, user-friendly interfaces, like product lists and shopping carts.


Milestone 2: 

Key Achievements
1. Project Structure:
Organized the project into frontend and backend directories for better maintainability.
Backend set up with Node.js to handle server-side logic, and the frontend set up with React to build the user interface.
2. React Frontend Setup:
Initialized a React app to manage the UI, allowing the e-commerce platform to be interactive.
3. Node.js Backend Setup:
Configured a basic Node.js server to lay the foundation for upcoming API integrations and user authentication.
4. Tailwind CSS Configuration:
Integrated Tailwind CSS for utility-first, responsive styling to enhance UI development speed.
5. Login Page Development:
Designed and built a functional Login Page with form validation and styling using Tailwind.


Milestone 3: 

In this milestone, we focused on building the foundation for the backend of our e-commerce application. The key objectives were to set up a server, connect it to a database, and establish a solid folder structure to keep our code organized.

Backend Folder Structure: We created a structured hierarchy for organizing backend code. This includes dedicated folders for routes, controllers, models, and middleware. This structure will make it easier to scale the project as more features are added in future milestones.

Server Setup: We initialized a Node.js server using the Express framework. The server is now configured to handle API requests, and it listens on a designated port for incoming requests.

Database Connection: We integrated MongoDB into the project to store and manage data. The server is now connected to MongoDB, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval.

Error Handling: Basic error-handling mechanisms were added to ensure that the server can respond with clear error messages for better debugging and user feedback.


Milestone 4: 

In Milestone 4, we focused on enhancing the backend by creating a User Model, setting up a User Controller, and enabling file uploads using Multer. These features are key to handling user data and media effectively in the e-commerce app.

User Model: We created a User Model, which defines how user data is stored in the database. This includes fields such as name, email, and password. We used MongoDB schemas to design the structure and validation rules for each user.

User Controller: The User Controller was developed to manage user-related requests, such as creating a new user and retrieving user information. This controller acts as the manager that handles data processing and communication between the frontend and the database.

File Uploads with Multer: We integrated Multer to enable file uploads, allowing users to upload images (e.g., profile pictures). Multer manages the file storage and ensures that the files are saved securely in the backend.


Milestone 5: 

In Milestone 5, we focused on building the Sign-Up Page for the frontend, where users can register by entering their details. This page includes essential fields such as name, email, and password, providing a clean and user-friendly interface for registration.

Frontend UI Development: We designed the Sign-Up Page using HTML and CSS. The page was structured to be intuitive, ensuring users can easily input their data to create an account.

Form Validation: Form validation was added to ensure that user inputs are accurate and meet the required format. For example, we validated the email format and enforced a minimum password length to enhance security. This step helps avoid errors and ensures only valid data is submitted to the backend.

UI/UX Enhancements: The design is simple yet effective, allowing users to smoothly enter their details. We focused on making the form clean and responsive, ensuring it works across devices.



Milestone 6: 

In this milestone, we focused on building the foundation for the backend of our e-commerce application. The key objectives were to set up a server, connect it to a database, and establish a solid folder structure to keep our code organized.

Backend Folder Structure: We created a structured hierarchy for organizing backend code. This includes dedicated folders for routes, controllers, models, and middleware. This structure will make it easier to scale the project as more features are added in future milestones.

Error Handling: Basic error-handling mechanisms were added to ensure that the server can respond with clear error messages for better debugging and user feedback.

Milestone 7:

In this milestone, I implemented a secure login authentication system with password hashing using bcrypt. The functionality includes:
	1.	User Registration:
	•	Users can register by providing a username and password.
	•	The password is securely hashed before being stored in the database using bcrypt.
	2.	User Login:
	•	Users can log in with their username and password.
	•	The entered password is hashed using bcrypt and compared with the stored hashed password in the database.
	•	If the credentials match, the user is authenticated and can proceed further in the application.
	•	If the credentials are invalid, an error message is returned.
	3.	Security Features:
	•	Passwords are never stored in plain text; they are hashed using the bcrypt algorithm.
	•	This ensures that even if the database is compromised, user passwords remain secure.

The main goal of this milestone was to establish a secure login system that validates user credentials and ensures the safety of sensitive user data. In the next milestone, I plan to integrate additional security features, such as JWT-based user sessions.
